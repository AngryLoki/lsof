How Lsof Works
--------------

Before getting on with porting guidelines, just a word or two about
how lsof works.

Lsof obtains data about open UNIX dialect files by reading the
kernel's proc structure information, following it to the related
user structure, then reading the open file structures stored
(usually) in the user structure.  Typically lsof uses the kernel
memory devices, /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, etc. to read kernel data.

Lsof stores information from the proc and user structures in an
internal, local proc structure table.  It then processes the open
file structures by reading the file system nodes that lie behind
them, extracting and storing relevant data in internal local file
structures that are linked to the internal local process structure.

Once all data has been gathered, lsof reports it from its internal,
local tables.

There are a few variants on this subject.  Some systems don't have
just proc structures, but have task structures, too, (e.g., NeXTSTEP
and OSF/1 derivatives).  For some dialects lsof gets proc structures
or process information (See "/proc-based Linux Lsof -- a Different
Approach) from files of the /proc file system.  It's not necessary
for lsof to read user structures on some systems (recent versions
of HP-UX), because the data lsof needs can be found in the task or
proc structures.  In the end lsof gathers the same data, just from
slightly different sources.


/proc-based Linux Lsof -- a Different Approach
==============================================

For a completely different approach to lsof construction, take a
look at the /proc-based Linux sources in .../dialects/linux/proc.
(The sources in .../dialects/linux/kmem are for a traditional lsof
that uses /dev/kmem to read information from kernel structures.)

The /proc-based lsof obtains all its information from the Linux
/proc file system.  Consequently, it is relatively immune to changes
in Linux kernel structures and doesn't need to be re-compiled each
time the Linux kernel version changes.

There are some down-sides to the Linux /proc-based lsof:

    *  It must run setuid-root in order to be able to read the
       /proc file system branches for all processes.  In contrast,
       the /dev/kmem-based Linux lsof usually needs only setgid
       permission.

    *  It depends on the exact character format of /proc files, so
       it is sensitive to changes in /proc file composition.

    *  It is limited to the information a /proc file system
       implementor decides to provide.  For example, if a
       /proc/net/<protocol> file lacks an inode number, the
       /proc-based lsof can't connect open socket files to that
       protocol.  Another deficiency is that the /proc-based may
       not be able to report file offset (position) information,
       when it isn't available in the /proc/<PID>/fd/ entry for a
       file.

       In contrast the /dev/kmem-based lsof has full access to
       kernel structures and "sees" new data as soon as it appears.
       Of course, that new data requires that lsof be recompiled
       and usually also requires changes to lsof.

Overall the switch from a /dev/kmem base to a /proc one is an
advantage to Linux lsof.  The switch was made at lsof revision 4.23
for Linux kernel versions 2.1.72 (approximately) and higher.  The
reason I'm not certain at which Linux kernel version a /proc-based
lsof becomes possible is that the /proc additions needed to implement
it have been added gradually to Linux 2.1.x in ways that I cannot
measure.

/proc-based lsof functions in many ways the same as /dev/kmem-based
lsof.  It scans the /proc directory, looking for <PID>/ subdirectories.
Inside each one it collects process-related data from the cwd, exe,
maps, root, and stat information files.

It collects open file information from the fd/ subdirectory of each
<PID>/ subdirectory.  The lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) system
calls gather information about the files from the kernel.

Lock information comes from /proc/locks.  It is matched to open
files by inode number.  Mount information comes from /proc/mounts.
Per domain protocol information comes from the files of /proc/net;
it's matched to open socket files by inode number.

The Linux /proc file system implementors have done an amazing job
of providing the information lsof needs.  The /proc-based lsof
project has so far generated only two kernel modification:

    *  A modification to /usr/src/linux/net/ipx/af_ipx.c adds the
       inode number to the entries of /proc/net/ipx.

       Jonathan Sergent did this kernel modification.

       It may be found in the .../dialects/linux/proc/patches
       subdirectory of the lsof distribution.

    *  An experimental modification to /usr/src/linux/fs/stat.c
       allows lstat(2) to return file position information for
       /proc/<PID>/fd/<FD> files.
       
       Contact me for this modification.


One final note about the /proc-based Linux lsof: it doesn't need
any functions from the lsof library in the lib/ subdirectory.


General Guidelines
------------------

These are the general guidelines for porting lsof 4 to a new Unix
dialect:

    *  Understand the organization of the lsof sources and the
       philosophies that guide their coding.

    *  Understand the data requirements and determine the methods
       of locating the necessary data in the new dialect's kernel.

    *  Pick a name for the subdirectory in lsof4/dialects for your
       dialect.  Generally I use a vendor operating system name
       abbreviation.

    *  Locate the necessary header files and #include them in the
       dialect's dlsof.h file.  (You may not be able to complete
       this step until you have coded all dialect-specific functions.)

    *  Determine the optional library functions of lsof to be used
       and set their definitions in the dialect's machine.h file.

    *  Define the dialect's specific symbols and global storage
       in the dialect's dlsof.h and dstore.c files.

    *  Code the dialect-specific functions in the appropriate
       source files of the dialect's subdirectory.

       Include the necessary prototype definitions of the dialect-
       specific functions in the dproto.h file in the dialect's
       subdirectory.

    *  Define the dialect's Makefile and source construction shell
       script, Mksrc.

    *  If there are #define's that affect how kernel structures
       are organized, and those #define's are needed when compiling
       lsof, build a MkKernOpts shell script to locate the #define's
       and supply them to the Configure shell script.


Organization
------------

The code in a dialect-specific version of lsof comes from three
sources:

    1)  functions common to all versions, located in the top level
	directory, lsof4;

    2)  functions specific to the dialect, located in the dialect's
	subdirectory -- e.g., lsof4/dialects/sun;

    3)  functions that are common to several dialects, although
	not to all, organized in a library, liblsof.a.  The functions
	in the library source can be selected and customized with
	definitions in the dialect machine.h header files.

The tree looks like this:

			    lsof4 ----------------------+ 3) library --
			    |   \			     lsof4/lib
  1) fully common functions +    \
      e.g., lsof4/main.c	  + lsof4/dialects/
			   / / / / \
			   + + + +  +
  2) dialect-specific subdirectories -- e.g., lsof4/dialects/sun

The code for a dialect-specific version is constructed from these
three sources by the Configure shell script in the top level lsof4
directory and definitions in the dialect machine.h header files.
Configure uses the Mksrc shell script in each dialect's subdirectory,
and may use an optional MkKernOpts shell script in selected dialect
subdirectories.

Configure calls the Mksrc shell script in each dialect's subdirectory
to assemble the dialect-specific sources in the main lsof directory.
Configure may call MkKernOpts to determine kernel compile-time
options that are needed for compiling kernel structures correctly
for use by lsof.  Configure puts the options in a dialect-specific
Makefile it build, using a template in the dialect subdirectory.

The assembly of dialect-specific sources in the main lsof directory
is usually done by creating symbolic links from the top level to
the dialect's subdirectory.  The LSOF_MKC environment variable may
be defined prior to using Configure to change the technique used
to assemble the sources -- most commonly to use cp instead of ln -s.

The Configure script completes the dialect's Makefile by adding
string definitions, including the necessary kernel compile-time
options, to a dialect skeleton Makefile while copying it from the
dialect subdirectory to the top level lsof4 directory.  Optionally
Makefile may call the dialect's MkKernOpts script to add string
definitions.

When the lsof library, lsof4/lib/liblsof.a, is compiled its
functions are selected and customized by #define's in the dialect
machine.h header file.


Source File Naming Conventions
------------------------------

With one exception, dialect-specific source files begin with a
lower case `d' character -- ddev.c, dfile.c, dlsof.h.  The one
exception is the header file that contains dialect-specific
definitions for the optional features of the common functions.
It's called machine.h for historical reasons.

Currently all dialects use almost the same source file names.  One
exception to the rule happens in dialects where there must be
different source files -- e.g., dnode[123].c -- to eliminate node
header file structure element name conflicts.  The source modules
in a few subdirectories are organized that way.

Unusual situations occur for NetBSD and OpenBSD, and for NEXTSTEP
and OPENSTEP.  Each pair of dialects is so close in design that
the same dialect sources from the n+obsd subdirectory serves NetBSD
and OpenBSD; from n+os, NEXTSTEP and OPENSTEP.

These are common files in lsof4/:

    Configure	the configuration script

    Customize	does some customization of the selected lsof
		dialect

    Inventory	takes an inventory of the files in an lsof
		distribution

    version	the version number

    dialects/	the dialects subdirectory

These are the common function source files in lsof4/:

    arg.c	common argument processing functions

    lsof.h	common header file that #include's the dialect-specific
		header files

    main.c	common main function for lsof 4

    misc.c	common miscellaneous functions -- e.g., special versions
		of stat() and readlink()

    node.c	common node reading functions -- readinode(), readvnode()

    print.c	common print support functions

    proc.c	common process and file structure functions

    proto.h	common prototype definitions, including the definition of
		the _PROTOTYPE() macro

    store.c	common global storage version.h	the current lsof version
		number, derived from the file version by the Makefile

    usage.c	functions to display lsof usage panel

These are the dialect-specific files:

    Makefile	the Makefile skeleton

    Mksrc	a shell script that assists the Configure script
		in configuring dialect sources

    MkKernOpts  an optional shell script that identifies kernel
		compile-time options for selected dialects -- e.g.,
		Pyramid DC/OSx and Reliant UNIX

    ddev.c	device support functions -- readdev() -- may be
		eliminated by functions from lsof4/lib/

    dfile.c	file processing functions -- may be eliminated by
		functions from lsof4/lib/

    dlsof.h	dialect-specific header file -- contains #include's
		for system header files and dialect-specific global
		storage declarations

    dmnt.c	mount support functions -- may be eliminated by
		functions from lsof4/lib/

    dnode.c	node processing functions -- e.g., for gnode or vnode

    dnode?.c	additional node processing functions, used when node
		header files have duplicate and conflicting element
		names.

    dproc.c	functions to access, read, examine and cache data about
		dialect-specific process structures -- this file contains
		the dialect-specific "main" function, gather_proc_info()

    dproto.h	dialect-specific prototype declarations

    dsock.c	dialect-specific socket processing functions

    dstore.c	dialect-specific global storage -- e.g., the nlist()
		structure

    machine.h	dialect specific definitions of common function options --
		e.g., a HASINODE definition to activate the readinode()
		function in lsof4/node.c

		The machine.h header file also selects and customizes
		the functions of lsof4/lib/.

These are the lib/ files.  Definitions in the dialect machine.h
header files select and customize the contained functions that are
to be compiled and archived to liblsof.a.

Coding Philosophies
-------------------

A few basic philosophies govern the coding of lsof 4 functions:

    *  Use as few #if/#else/#endif constructs as possible, even at
       the cost of nearly-duplicate code.

       When #if/#else/#endif constructs are necessary:
       
       o  Use the form

		#if	defined(s<symbol>)
	
	  in preference to
	
		#ifdef	<symbol>
	
	  to allow easier addition of tests to the #if.

       o  Indent them to signify their level -- e.g.,

		#if	/* level one */
		# if	/* level two */
		# endif	/* level two */
		#else	/* level one */
		#endif	/* level one */

	o  Use ANSI standard comments on #else and #endif statements.

    *  Document copiously.

    *  Aim for ANSI-C compatibility:
    
       o  Use function prototypes for all functions, hiding them
	  from compilers that cannot handle them with the _PROTOTYPE()
	  macro.

       o  Use the compiler's ANSI conformance checking wherever
	  possible -- e.g., gcc's -ansi option.


Data Requirements
-----------------

Lsof's strategy in obtaining open file information is to access
the process table via its proc structures, then obtain the associated
user area and open file structures.  The open file structures then
lead lsof to file type specific structures -- cdrnodes, fifonodes,
inodes, gnodes, hsfsnodes, pipenodes, pcnodes, rnodes, snodes,
sockets, tmpnodes, and vnodes.

The specific node structures must yield data about the open files.  The
most important items and device number (raw and cooked) and node
number.  (Lsof uses them to identify files and file systems named as
arguments.)  Link counts and file sizes are important, too, as are the
special characteristics of sockets, pipes, FIFOs, etc.

This means that to begin an lsof port to a new Unix dialect you
must understand how to obtain these structures from the dialect's
kernel.  Look for kernel access functions -- e.g., the AIX readx()
function, Sun and Sun-like kvm_*() functions, or SGI's syssgi()
function.  Look for clues in header files -- e.g. external declarations
and macros.

If you have access to them, look at sources to programs like ps(1),
or the freely available monitor and top programs.  They may give
you important clues on reading proc and user area structures.  An
appeal to readers of dialect-specific news groups may uncover
correspondents who can help.

Careful reading of system header files -- e.g., <sys/proc.h> --
may give hints about how kernel storage is organized.  Look for
global variables declared under a KERNEL or _KERNEL #if.  Run nm(1)
across the kernel image (/vmunix, /unix, etc.) and look for references
to structures of interest.

Even if there are support functions for reading structures, like the
kvm_*() functions, you must still understand how to read data from
kernel memory.  Typically this requires an understanding of the
nlist() function, and how to use /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, and /dev/swap.

Don't overlook the possibility that you may have to use the process
file system -- e.g., /proc.  I try to avoid using /proc when I can,
since it usually requires that lsof have setuid(root) permission
to read the individual /proc "files".

Once you can access kernel structures, you must understand how
they're connected.  You must answer questions like:

    *  How big are kernel addresses?  How are they type cast?

    *  How are kernel variable names converted to addresses?
       Nlist()?

    *  How are the proc structures organized?  Is it a static
       table?  Are the proc structures linked?  Is there a
       kernel pointer to the first proc structure?  Is there a
       proc structure count?

    *  How does one obtain copies of the proc structures?  Via
       /dev/kmem?  Via a vendor API?

    *  If this is a Mach derivative, is it necessary to obtain the
       task and thread structures?  How?

    *  How does one obtain the user area (or the utask area in Mach
       systems) that corresponds to a process?

    *  Where are the file structures located for open file
       descriptors and how are they located?  Are all file
       structures in the user area?  Is the file structure space
       extensible?

    *  Where do the private data pointers in file structures lead?
       To gnodes?  To inodes?  To sockets?  To vnodes?  Hint: look
       in <sys/file.h> for DTYPE_* instances and further pointers.

    *  How are the nodes organized?  To what other nodes do they
       lead and how?  Where are the common bits of information in
       nodes -- device, node number, size -- stored?  Hint: look
       in the header files for nodes for macros that may be used
       to obtain the address of one node from another -- e.g., the
       VTOI() macro that leads from a vnode to an inode.

    *  Are text reference nodes identified and how?  Is it
       necessary to examine the virtual memory map of a process or
       a task to locate text references?  Some kernels have text
       node pointers in the proc structures; some, in the user
       area; Mach kernels may have text information in the task
       structure, reached in various ways from the proc, user area,
       or user task structure.

    *  How is the device table -- e.g., /dev or /devices --
       organized?  How is it read?  Using direct or dirent structures?

       How are major/minor device numbers represented?  How are
       device numbers assembled and disassembled?

       Are there clone devices?  How are they identified?

    *  How is mount information obtained?  Getmntinfo()?  Getmntent()?
       Some special kernel call?

    *  How are sockets identified and organized?  BSD-style?  As
       streams?  Are there streams?

    *  Are there special nodes -- CD-ROM nodes, FIFO nodes, etc.?

    *  How is the kernel's name cache organized?  Can lsof access
       it to get partial name components?


Dlsof.h and #include's
----------------------

Once you have identified the kernel's data organization and know
what structures it provides, you must add #include's to dlsof.h to
access their definitions.  Sometimes it is difficult to locate the
header files -- you may need to introduce -I specifications in the
Makefile via the DINC shell variable in the Configure script.

Sometimes it is necessary to define special symbols -- e.g., KERNEL,
_KERNEL, _KMEMUSER -- to induce system header files to yield kernel
structure definitions.  Sometimes making those symbol definitions
cause other header file and definition conflicts.  There's no good
general rule on how to proceed when conflicts occur.

Rarely it may be necessary to extract structure definitions from
system header files and move them to dlsof.h, create special versions
of system header files, or obtain special copies of system header
files from "friendly" (e.g., vendor) sources.  The dlsof.h header
file in lsof4/dialects/sun shows examples of the first case; the
second, no examples; the third, the irix5hdr subdirectory in
lsof4/dialects/irix (a mixture of the first and third).

Building up the necessary #includes in dlsof.h is an iterative
process that requires attention as you build the dialect-specific
functions that references kernel structures.  Be prepared to revisit
dlsof.h frequently.


Definitions That Affect Compilation
-----------------------------------

The source files at the top level and in the lib/ subdirectory
contain optional functions that may be activated with definitions
in a dialect's machine.h header file.  Some are functions for
reading node structures that may not apply to all dialects -- e.g.
CD-ROM nodes (cdrnode), or `G' nodes (gnode) -- and others are
common functions that may occasionally be replaced by dialect-specific
ones.  Once you understand your kernel's data organization, you'll
be able to decide the optional common node functions to activate.

Definitions in machine.h and dlsof.h also enable or disable other
optional common features.  The following is an attempt to list all
the definitions that affect lsof code, but CAUTION, it is only
attempt and may be incomplete.  Always check lsof4 source code in

			a file in them. Some dialects (e.g., HP-UX)
			have many inaccessible subdirectories and
			it is appropriate to inhibit the warning
			for them with WARNDEVACCESS.  The -w option
			will also inhibit these warnings.

    WARNINGSTATE        when defined, disables the default issuing
			of warning messages.  WARNINGSTATE is
			undefined by default for all dialects in
			the lsof distribution.

    WIDECHARINCL        defines the header file to be included (if any)
			when wide-character support is enabled with
			HASWIDECHAR.

Any dialect's machine.h file and Configure stanza can serve as a
template for building your own.  All machine.h files usually have
all definitions, disabling some (with comment prefix and suffix)
and enabling others.


Options: Common and Special
---------------------------

All but one lsof option is common; the specific option is ``-X''.
If a dialect does not support a common option, the related #define
in machine.h -- e.g., HASCOPT -- should be deselected.

The specific option, ``-X'', may be used by any dialect for its
own purpose.  Right now (May 30, 1995) the ``-X'' option is binary
(i.e., it's not allowed arguments of its own, and its value must
be 0 or 1) but that could be changed should the need arise.  The
option is enabled with the HASXOPT definition in machine.h; its
default value is defined by HASXOPT_VALUE.

The value of HASXOPT should be the text displayed for ``-X'' by
the usage() function in usage.c.  HASXOPT_VALUE should be the
default value, 0 or 1.

AIX for the IBM RICS System/6000 defines the ``-X'' option to
control readx() usage, since there is a bug in AIX kernels that
readx() can expose for other processes.


Defining Dialect-Specific Symbols and Global Storage
----------------------------------------------------

A dialect's dlsof.h and dstore.c files contain dialect-specific
symbol and global storage definitions.  There are symbol definitions,
for example, for function and data casts, and for file paths.
Dslof.h defines lookup names the nlist() table -- X_* symbols --
when nlist() is being used.

Global storage definitions include such things as structures for
local Virtual File System (vfs) information; mount information;
search file information; and kernel memory file descriptors --
e.g., Kmem for /dev/kmem, Mem for /dev/mem, Swap for /dev/drum.


Coding Dialect-specific Functions
---------------------------------

Each supported dialect must have some basic functions that the
common functions of the top level may call.  Some of them may be
obtained from the library in lsof4/lib, selected and customized by
#define's in the dialect machine.h header file.  Others may have
to be coded specifically for the dialect.

Each supported dialect usually has private functions, too.  Those
are wholly determined by the needs of the dialect's data organization
and access.

These are some of the basic functions that each dialect must supply
-- they're all defined in proto.h:

    initialize()		function to initialize the dialect

    is_file_named()		function to check if a file was named
				by an optional file name argument
				(lsof4/lib/isfn.c)

    gather_proc_info()		function to gather process table
				and related information and cache it

    printchdevname()		function to locate and optionally
				print the name of a character device
				(lsof4/lib/pdvn.c)

    print_tcptpistate()         function to print the TCP or TPI
				state for a TCP or UDP socket file,
				if the one in lib/ptti.c isn't
				suitable (define USE_LIB_PRINT_TCPTPI
				to activate lib/ptti.c)

    process_file()		function to process an open file
				structure (lsof4/lib/prfp.c)

    process_node()		function to process a primary node

    process_socket()		function to process a socket

    readdev() and stkdir()	functions to read and cache device
				information (lsof4/lib/rdev.c)

    readmnt()			function to read mount table information
				(lsof4/lib/rmnt.c)

Other common functions may be needed, and might be obtained from
lsof4/lib, depending on the needs of the dialect's node and socket
file processing functions.

Check the functions in lsof4/lib and specific lsof4/dialects/*
files for examples.

As you build these functions you will probably have to add #include's
to dlsof.h.


Function Prototype Definitions and the _PROTOTYPE Macro
-------------------------------------------------------

Once you've defined your dialect-specific definitions, you should
define their prototypes in dproto.h or locally in the file where
they occur and are used.  Do this even if your compiler is not ANSI
compliant -- the _PROTOTYPE macro knows how to cope with that and
will avoid creating prototypes that will confuse your compiler.


The Makefile
------------

Here are some general rules for constructing the dialect Makefile.

    *  Use an existing dialect's Makefile as a template.

    *  Make sure the echo actions of the install rule are appropriate.

    *  Use the DEBUG string to set debugging options, like ``-g''.
       You may also need to use the -O option when forking and
       SIGCHLD signals defeat your debugger.

    *  Don't put ``\"'' in a compiler flags -D<symbol>=<string>
       clause in your Makefile.  Leave off the ``\"'' even though
       you want <string> to be a string literal and instead adapt
       the N_UNIX* macros you'll find in Makefiles for FreeBSD
       and Linux.  That will allow the Makefile's version.h rule
       to put CFLAGS into version.h without having to worry about
       the ``\"'' sequences.

    *  Finally, remember that strings can be passed from the top
       level's Configure shell script.  That's an appropriate way
       to handle options, especially if there are multiple versions
       of the Unix dialect to which you are porting lsof 4.


The Mksrc Shell Script
----------------------

Pattern your Mksrc shell script after an existing one from another
dialect.  Change the D shell variable to the name of your dialect's
subdirectory in lsof4/dialects.  Adjust any other shell variable
to your local conditions.  (Probably that won't be necessary.)

Note that, if using symbolic links from the top level to your
dialect subdirectory is impossible or impractical, you can set the
LSOF_MKC shell variable in Configure to something other than
"ln -s" -- e.g., "cp," and Configure will pass it to the Mksrc
shell script in the M environment variable.


The MkKernOpts Shell Script
---------------------------

The MkKernOptrs shell script is used by some dialects -- e.g.,
Pyramid DC/OSx and Reliant UNIX -- to determine the compile-time
options used to build the current kernel that affect kernel structure
definitions, so those same options can be used to build lsof.
Configure calls MkKernOpts for the selected dialects.

If your kernel is built with options that affect structure definitions.
-- most commonly affected are the proc structure from <sys/proc.h>
and the user structure from <sys/user.h> -- check the MkKernOpts
in lsof4/dialects/irix for a comprehensive example.


Testing and the Lsof Test Suite
-------------------------------

Once you have managed to create a port, here are some tips for
testing it.

*  First look at the test suite in the tests/ sub-directory of the
   lsof distribution.  While it will need to be customized to be
   usable with a new port, it should provide ideas on things to
   test.  Look for more information about the test suite in the
   00TEST file.

*  Pick a simple process whose open files you are likely to
   know and see if the lsof output agrees with what you know.
   (Hint: select the process with `lsof -p <process_PID>`.)

   Are the device numbers and device names correct?

   Are the file system names and mount points correct?

   Are inode numbers and sizes correct?

   Are command names, file descriptor numbers, UIDs, PIDs, PGIDs,
   and PPIDs correct?

   A simple tool that does a stat(2) of the files being examined
   and reports the stat struct contents can provide a reference for
   some values; so can `ls -l /dev/<device>`.

*  Let lsof list information about all open files and ask the
   same questions.  Look also for error messages about not being
   able to read a node or structure.

*  Pick a file that you know is open -- open it and hold it
   that way with a C program (not vi), if you must.  Ask lsof to
   find the file's open instance by specifying its path to lsof.

*  Create a C program that opens a large number of files and holds
   them open.  Background the test process and ask lsof to list
   its files.

*  Generate some locks -- you may need to write a C program to
   do this, hold the locked file open, and see if lsof can identify
   the lock properly.  You may need to write several C programs
   if your dialect supports different lock functions -- fnctl(),
   flock(), lockf(), locking().

*  Identify a process with known Internet file usage -- inetd
   is a good one -- and ask lsof to list its open files.  See if
   protocols and service names are listed properly.

   See if your lsof identifies Internet socket files properly for
   rlogind or telnetd processes.

*  Create a UNIX domain socket file, if your dialect allows it,
   hold it open by backgrounding the process, and see if lsof can
   identify the open UNIX domain socket file properly.

*  Create a FIFO file and see what lsof says about it.

*  Watch an open pipe -- `lsof -u <your_login>  | less` is a
   good way to do this.

*  See if lsof can identify NFS files and their devices properly.
   Open and hold open an NFS file and see if lsof can find the open
   instance by path.

*  If your test system has CD-ROM and floppy disk devices, open
   files on them and see if lsof reports their information correctly.
   Such devices often have special kernel structures associated
   with them and need special attention from lsof for their
   identification.  Pay particular attention to the inode numbers
   lsof reports for CD-ROM and floppy disk files -- often they are
   calculated dynamically, rather than stored in a kernel node
   structure.

*  If your implementation can probe the kernel name cache, look
   at some processes with open files whose paths you know to see
   if lsof identifies any name components.  If it doesn't, make
   sure the name components are in the name cache by accessing
   the files yourself with ls or a similar tool.

*  If your dialect supports the /proc file system, use a C program
   to open files there, background a test process, and ask lsof to
   report its open files.

*  If your dialect supports fattach(), create a small test program
   to use it, background a test process, and ask lsof to report
   its open files.

I can supply some quick-and-dirty tools for reporting stat buffer
contents, holding files open, creating UNIX domain files, creating
FIFOs, etc., if you need them.


Where Next?
-----------

Is this document complete?  Certainly not!  One might wish that it
were accompanied by man pages for all lsof functions, by free beer
or chocolates, by ...  (You get the idea.)

But those things are not likely to happen as long as lsof is a
privately supported, one man operation.

So, if you need more information on how lsof is constructed or
works in order to do a port of your own, you'll have to read the
lsof source code.  You can also ask me questions via email, but
keep in mind the private, one-man nature of current lsof support.
