# lsof-legacy
The final source tree published by Vic, the original lsof maintainer.

This repository has two branches "master" and "cleanup".

"master" branch keeps the original source tree. We received it
from Vic. We will not introduce many changes to the "master" branch.

The "master" branch includes directories and files that we don't need
to maintain the source tree at github.com. We would like to remove
such directories and files from the source tree before starting
maintenance at the lsof-org organization. We will commit the changes
removing them to "cleanup" branch incrementally.

After cleaning up is done, we will make a new repository called "lsof5"
based on the "cleanup" branch of "lsof-legacy" repository. The "lsof5"
repository is the repository you may want to contribute:-)
