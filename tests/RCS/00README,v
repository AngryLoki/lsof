		.../lsof_<version>/tests

This sub-directory contains support for lsof's test suite.  Find
more information about the test suite in the 00TESTS file of the
lsof distribution, which should be in in the parent of this
subdirectory.

These tests can be activated from .. with:

    $ make test

They can be activated from this directory with:

    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make all

These tests are all written in C, so individual tests may be
activated by executing them directly -- e.g.,

    $ ./LTlock

It may sometimes be necessary to use execution-time options
alter test behavior.  (Some tests will suggest that when they
encounter certain kinds of errors.)  See the 00FAQ and 00TEST files
in .. for more information.

These tests check lsof field output, not lsof text output.  There
are no tests for lsof text output.

Here is a brief description of the files in this subdirectory:

    00README		this file

    Add2TestDB          a script to add the identity of the current
			test to TestDB

    CkTestDB		a script to check the identity of this
			dialect against the TestDB file

    config.cc           a file prepared by ../Configure that contains
			the name (and possibly the path) to the C
			compiler for the programs of this sub-directory

    config.cflags       a file prepared by ../Configure that contains
			C compiler flags for the programs of this
			sub-directory

    config.libs		a file prepared by ../Configure that contains
			library load specifications -- i.e, make(1)
			LDFLAGS

    config.xobj         a file prepared by ../Configure that contains
			paths to any extra object files (*.o) needed
			by the C programs in this directory

    LsofTest.h		lsof test definitions for C programs

    LTbasic.c		C source to basic lsof tests

    LTbigf.c		C source to a program that tests large file
			sizes and offsets on dialects that support
			file sizes > 32 bits

    LTdnlc.c            C source to a program that tests the
			effectiveness of assembling path names from
			the kernel's Dynamic Name Lookup Cache
			(DNLC)

    LTlib.c		a support library in C

    LTlock.c		C source to a program that tests lock reporting

    LTnfs		C source to a program that tests for open NFS
			files

    LTnlink.c           C source to a program that tests lsof's
			reporting of open file link counts

    LTsock.c            C source to program that tests the finding
			of IPv4 sockets

    LTszoff.c           C source to a program that tests file sizes
			and offsets  -- see LTbigf.c for a large
			file (size > 32 bits) test

    LTunix.c		C source to a program that tests the finding
			of UNIX domain sockets

    Makefile		the make(1) control file

			The Makefile clean rule will not remove
			config.* files, but the spotless rule will.
			One the spotless rule has been used,
			../Configure must be re-run.

    TestDB              a data base of dialects where the test
			suite has been validated

Individual Perl tests may be activated by naming them as a Perl
argument -- e.g.,

    $ perl itself

It may sometimes be necessary to define environment variables to
